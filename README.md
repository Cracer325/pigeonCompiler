# Pigeon compiler :)
a compiler for a very basic language
## Explanations:
there are 3 key words, print, let, and exit
### let:
let is used to declare variables, ex: let x = 3;
let y = 3+x;
<br> note that -5+2 isn't supported yet (you can however do 2-5)
### print:
to print you do print(int);, the int is an ascii value, you can also chain: <br>
print(int1, int2, int3, ...);
### exit:
to end the program use exit(int); where the int is the exit code.
